5. By default, it will open up the `MATERIALS` folder for you to put files in there.  
If you did "step 2" then simply close the window and press any key to continue. 

::: tip Tip
You can disable auto folder opening from settings.

6. If everything went good, it should show a list files that it is going to replace like this...

Here, you can press, 

**[Y]** to confirm replacement/injection  

**[R]** to refresh the file list  
::: info Info
Use this if you want to include other `.material.bin` files in the `MATERIALS` as well.  
After adding files, pressing **[R]** should show new files in the list.
:::  

**[N]** to cancel.  
It will return to the main screen.  

7. Accept admin permission requests.

Based on the situation, it will ask you 2 or 4 times. You have to accept all.  

<br><br>

**Congratulations! You have applied a shader succesfully.**  

If there is a MCPACK for the materials it's better to import and activate it.

::: tip
If you're changing shaders, you don't have to restore manually.  
It will automatically restore files as needed.
