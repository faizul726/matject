# What is matjectNEXT?

matjectNEXT is **an advanced variant** of Matject that works by looking at the first currently activated pack in global resource packs.  
\
While monitoring resource packs it can replace/restore game files automatically.  
Means no need to provide/select MCPACK again and again.

::: warning Note
**matjectNEXT is still in BETA.**  
So far, it works fine but may not work properly for some.
