# Important notes

Matject is not perfect. It's not failproof either.  
Means in some cases, it may not be able to tell something went wrong. Or not work at all.  

<br>

- Always get Matject from the [official GitHub repository](https://github.com/faizul726/matject)
- YOU MUST BEGIN WITH ORIGINAL GAME FILES.  
Or even if you restore, shaders will NOT go away.  
If you don't have original files/already modified materials you can use [Replace current backup with ZIP](/docs/replace-current-backup-with-zip) in Matject.
- DO NOT modify `.settings`, `Backups`, `modules` folder without "proper knowledge"
::: details If you use Windows Defender/Microsoft Defender...
* You can keep real time protection enabled
* Disable ransomware protection/controlled folder access for the drive where Matject and Minecraft is located.  
Although, it's better to fully disable it temporarily while using Matject. As I haven't tested that way yet.
:::
::: details If you use any other antivirus...
* Turn it off temporarily while using Matject
* AVG is known to prevent IObit Unlocker from working
* Temporarily disable any kind of protection that may prevent programs from modifying files
:::
- In rare cases the original backup may get corrupted. In that case, you can either replace current backup with zip or reinstall the game
