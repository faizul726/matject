# Helpful tips

* Run Matject as admin to skip all admin requests as well as automatically closing IObit Unlocker success messages.  
* If you don't want to run the whole thing as admin then you can only run the injection part by enabling "Run IObit Unlocker as admin".
* You can make desktop and start menu shortcuts.
* If you're already familiar with Matject you can "Disable confirmations"
* Enable material-updater to make much older RenderDragon shaders work.
* Set default method if you usually use just one method.
