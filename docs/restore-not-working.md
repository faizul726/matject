# Restore not working!

I told you to "read" but you didn't.  
Pathetic...

::: details Solution
First, read 2, 4, 5th point [here](/docs/important-notes).

::: details Still not fixed
Read 2nd point [here](/docs/important-notes).  
"If you don't have original files" part to be specific.

::: details Tried... didn't work
That's very unlikely to happen. If you think you are supportive enough to give proper details and do screen share then join [Newb Discord Server](https://faizul726.github.io/newb-discord) and leave a message in #newb-support.  

I will eventually try to solve your problem.
