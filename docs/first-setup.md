# First setup

1. Once the download is finished, extract the ZIP file

<br>

2. Open the folder where you extracted, then go to `matject-main`

3. Open `matject` file

If something like this shows up, click `Run` and optionally turn off "Always ask before opening this file" to avoid annoyance.

5. "Read" ~~(Hint: Write yes and enter)~~ <img style="display: inline; vertical-align: middle;" width="28px" alt=":hahayes:" src="/stolen_emojis/hahayes.png" title="stolen from YSS discord server">

6. Use "common sense" <img style="display: inline; vertical-align: text-bottom;" width="24px" alt=":doggysmurk:" src="/stolen_emojis/doggysmurk.png" title="stolen from YSS discord server">  
Because depending on the situation it may not be the same always. So, a fixed guide won't help here.

::: tip
You have to navigate using keyboard buttons.  
All actions are labelled with the key to press.  

&nbsp;

You have to "click" for a short time (same as how you press `ENTER`)  
But don't "hold".  
Holding may cause it to do something unintended.
