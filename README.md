# Matject v2.0

### What?
Matject is a material replacer that allows users to use Minecraft shaders. It automates the process of replacing and restoring game files.

### How?
It uses IObit Unlocker to replace/restore game files since Windows doesn't normally allow modifying apps.

### Why?
[BetterRenderDragon](https://github.com/ddf8196/BetterRenderDragon/) still doesn't support version above v1.21.2. Windows players who want to try shaders have to replace game files manually which is a pretty time consuming process.  
So, I made this script so users don't have to go through the hassle of replacing game files by themselves.

<br>

>[!IMPORTANT]  
> Before you complain about game crashing/unable to see blocks, make sure the shader you're using supports **Windows** and the game version. 

<br>

## Features
* Easy to use.
* Takes less than 2 minutes to use a shader.

## FAQ
**Q. How is this different from [BetterRenderDragon](https://github.com/ddf8196/BetterRenderDragon/)?**  
A. BetterRenderDragon uses far more superior 'memory injection', all the changes are made in memory and those don't persist. You have to open BRD each time to use shaders. It's not universal, so BRD devs have to update it for newer Minecraft versions to make it work. *Changes made by Matject persists until next update. It's mostly universal, so it will work with any Minecraft version.*

**Q. Virus?**  
A. Well, depends on you. (2)
