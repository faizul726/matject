### What?
Matject is an **advanced material replacer** that allows users to use Minecraft shaders. It dynamically automates the process of replacing and restoring game files.

### How?
It uses IObit Unlocker to replace/restore game files since Windows doesn't normally allow modifying apps.

### Why?
**[BetterRenderDragon](https://github.com/ddf8196/BetterRenderDragon/) still doesn't support version above v1.21.2 (as of Dec 06).**  
Windows players who want to try shaders have to replace game files manually which is a pretty time consuming process.  
I made this script so that users don't have to go through the hassle of replacing game files by themselves.

</br>

>[!IMPORTANT]  
> Before you complain about game crashing/invisible blocks, make sure the shader you're using supports **Windows** and the **game version**.  
> 
> ***You can also enable material-updater in settings to fix invisible blocks.***
>
> **Non RenderDragon shaders (aka HAL) are not supported.**

</br>

## What's new in v3.2.2?
* Added custom Minecraft launcher support (thanks to [@TrngN0786](https://x.com/TrngN0786)) 
* [See full changelog](#changelog)

</br>

* Backup/restore game files.
* Many useful options in settings.

## How to use?

1. Install [IObit Unlocker](https://www.iobit.com/en/iobit-unlocker.php). (don't change its install location)

![screenshot](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4422464e-26a3-4068-993e-adc76817ca9c)

2. Download code as ZIP.

3. Extract the ZIP file.
4. Open `matject.bat`.
5. The rest is self explanatory.

</br>

### How to restore to default?
> [!TIP]  
> Original files will be restored automatically after the game is updated.

1. Open Matject.
2. Go to **[R] Restore & Others**.
3. Go to **[1] Restore default materials**
4. Select **Dynamic Restore** or **Full Restore** (full restore takes a bit more time).

</br>

## Known issues
* Some terms may be a bit too technical. Suggestions are appreciated.
* Doesn't support manifests with // or /**/ comments (matjectNEXT).
* Doesn't support long folder path and too many shader files.

</br>

## FAQ
**Q. What is matjectNEXT?**  
A. matjectNEXT is an advanced version of Matject that replaces materials based on the pack the user has set in Global Resource Packs, with help of **[jq](https://jqlang.github.io/jq)**.  
*Inspired by [Draco](https://github.com/mcbegamerxx954/draco-injector) by @mcbegamerxx954*.

**Q. How is this different from [BetterRenderDragon](https://github.com/ddf8196/BetterRenderDragon/)?**  
A. BetterRenderDragon uses *memory injection*, all the changes are made in memory and those don't persist. You have to open BRD each time to use shaders.  
*It's not universal, so BRD devs have to update it for newer Minecraft versions to make it work.*  
**Changes made by Matject persists until next game update.** It's mostly universal, so it should work with any Minecraft version.

**Q. Virus?**  
A. Well, depends on you. (2)

**Q. Does it require internet?**  
A. Yes, optionally...
* To check for updates and show the changelog. (it can't update itself yet)
* To get [jq](https://jqlang.github.io/jq) by itself (for matjectNEXT).  
* To get [material-updater](https://github.com/mcbegamerxx954/material-updater) by itself.  

**Q. What folders does it access?**  
A. It accesses the following folders:  
> ###### READ only:
> - `%ProgramFiles(x86)%\IObit\IObit Unlocker\IObitUnlocker` (backbone of Matject)
> - Minecraft app location. *Which is obtained using this PowerShell command:*
> ```powershell
> Get-AppxPackage -Name Microsoft.MinecraftUWP | Select-Object -ExpandProperty InstallLocation
> ```
> - `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Packages\Microsoft.MinecraftUWP_8wekyb3d8bbwe\LocalState\games\com.mojang\minecraftpe\global_resource_packs.json` (for matjectNEXT)
> - `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Packages\Microsoft.MinecraftUWP_8wekyb3d8bbwe\LocalState\games\com.mojang\resource_packs\*` (for matjectNEXT)
> - `.settings` `Backups\*` `logs` `MATERIALS` `MCPACK` `modules\*` `tmp`
> - `Custom Minecraft app, data, IObit Unlocker folder`
>
> ###### READ and WRITE:
> - `%ProgramFiles%\WindowsApps` (to unlock WindowsApps)
> - `%ProgramFiles%\WindowsApps\Microsoft.MinecraftUWP_*_*__8wekyb3d8bbwe\data\renderer\materials`
> - `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Packages\Microsoft.MinecraftUWP_8wekyb3d8bbwe\LocalState\games\com.mojang\minecraftpe\global_resource_packs.json` (to reset global packs)
> - `.settings` `Backups\*` `logs` `MATERIALS` `tmp`
> - `Custom Minecraft app, data`
