# üõ†Ô∏è Requirements
- [IObit Unlocker](https://www.iobit.com/en/iobit-unlocker.php) installed (mandatory, no need to do anything with it afterwards)
- PowerShell (mandatory) (pre installed on most Windows systems by default)
- Ability to read
- Common sense  
`Sorry for being rude, I am tired of spoonfeeding clueless people.`

</br>

# üìó Here's what you need to know
- Only RenderDragon shaders for Windows/Merged are supported.

- You don't have to open Matject everytime for shaders. It's only needed when you want to apply/swap/remove shaders.  
  Once shader is applied **it will stay** until you update the game or use shader removal from Matject.

- Check out Matject Settings to fine tune it to your needs.

	<ul>
		<li>The word "Injection" here means file replacement.</li>
		<li>Matject doesn't patch your game. So just removing shader from resource pack won't work. Use Shader Removal of Matject for that.</li>
		<li>Always try to use latest version. Matject has a built in updater to update itself.</li>
		<li>Matject is universal. It will continue to work fine as long as Mojang doesn't heavily changes how shaders work.</li>
		<li>Avoid downloading Matject from random links except <a href=https://github.com/faizul726/matject>github.com/faizul726/matject</a></li>
		<li>If blocks become invisible after injecting, enable material-updater from Matject Settings.</li>

> Original files are restored automatically when the game is updated.

1. Open Matject.
2. Go to **[R] Shader removal/Tools**.
3. Go to **[1] Shader Removal / Restore default materials**
4. Select **[1] Dynamic Restore** or **[2] Full Restore** (both are same, except full restore takes a bit more time).

## ü§î FAQ
**Q. Is it safe?**  
A. Yes, it is. You're welcome to review the code.

**Q. What is matjectNEXT?**  
A. matjectNEXT is an advanced version of Matject that replaces materials based on the pack the user has set in Global Resource Packs, with help of **[jq](https://jqlang.github.io/jq)**.  
Inspired by [Draco](https://github.com/mcbegamerxx954/draco-injector) which is made by [@mcbegamerxx954](https://github.com/mcbegamerxx954/).

**Q. How is this different from [BetterRenderDragon](https://github.com/ddf8196/BetterRenderDragon/)?**  
A. BetterRenderDragon uses *memory injection*, all the changes are made in memory and those don't persist. You have to open BRD each time to use shaders.  
*It's not universal, so BRD devs have to update it for newer Minecraft versions to make it work.*  
Changes made by Matject will stay until Minecraft is updated or user restores default materials from Matject.  
It's mostly universal, so it should work with any Minecraft version.

**Q. Does it require internet to work?**  
A. No, internet is optionally used to enhance user experience
* To check for updates and show the changelog. Updating is optional.
* To show Matject announcements
* To get [jq](https://jqlang.github.io/jq) by itself (for matjectNEXT).  
* To get [material-updater](https://github.com/mcbegamerxx954/material-updater) by itself.  

**Q. I have questions/need help.**  
A. Ask in one of the Discord servers [above](#need-help)


**Q. What folders does it access?**  
<details closed>
<summary>A. It accesses the following folders: </summary>
