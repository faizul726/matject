<br>

**What?**  
Matject is an **advanced material replacer** that allows users to use Minecraft shaders. It dynamically automates the process of replacing and restoring game files.
 
**How?**  
It uses IObit Unlocker to replace/restore game files since Windows doesn't allow modifying apps.

**Why?**  
**[BetterRenderDragon](https://github.com/ddf8196/BetterRenderDragon/) still doesn't support version above v1.21.2 (as of Feb 21).**  
Windows players who want to try shaders have to replace game files manually which is a pretty time consuming process.  
I made this script so that users don't have to go through the hassle of replacing game files by themselves.

<br>
<hr>
<br>

>[!IMPORTANT]  
> Make sure the shader you're using supports **Windows** and the **game version**.  
> Otherwise, you will see invisible blocks or the game will crash.
> 
> ***You can also enable material-updater in settings to fix invisible blocks.***
>
> * **Non RenderDragon shaders (aka HAL) are not supported.**  
> * You don't need BetterRenderDragon to use Matject.
> * You don't have to open Matject every time for shaders.
> * DO NOT USE Matject on debloated/optimized Windows (Atlas/Revi/Tiny/Chris Titus Tool)
> * Matject ‚â† Patched

# üí° Quick Guide

**See [Guide for Beginners](https://faizul726.github.io/matject/docs/guide-for-beginners) for a better explanation.**

<br>

1. Install [IObit Unlocker](https://www.iobit.com/en/iobit-unlocker.php). (don't change its install location)  

![screenshot](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4422464e-26a3-4068-993e-adc76817ca9c)

<br>

2. Download code as ZIP.  
Or use `git clone https://github.com/faizul726/matject.git` if you prefer.

3. Extract the ZIP file.
4. Open `matject.bat`.
5. The rest is self explanatory.  

**See üìò [Detailed Guide](https://faizul726.github.io/matject/docs/guide-for-beginners)**

<br><br>

## üîÑ How to restore to default / uninstall shaders?
> [!TIP]  
> Original files are restored automatically when the game is updated.

1. Open Matject.
2. Go to **[R] Remove Shaders/Tools**.
3. Go to **[1] Restore default materials**
4. Select **[1] Dynamic Restore** or **[2] Full Restore** (full restore takes a bit more time).

</br>

## ‚≠ê Features
* **Easy to use:** <u>no Command Prompt/Terminal knowledge</u> is required.
* **Fully offline:** Can be used offline. Internet is optionally used to enhance experience.
* **Fast as jet**: Takes less than <u>60 seconds</u> to apply a shader. 
* **Automatic backups:** Backups are made automatically when game is updated.
* **Restore game files:** You can go back to original whenever you want. 
* **Automatic processing:** MCPACK/ZIPs are automatically processed.
* **Auto shader updater:** Shaders can be updated using [material-updater](https://github.com/mcbegamerxx954/material-updater) (also fixes invisible blocks).
* **Auto updater:** Can automatically update itself if you want.
* **Dynamic file replacement:** Keeps track of modified files and restores if needed.
* **Highly customizable:** Adjustments according to your needs can be made in Matject Settings.
* **matjectNEXT:** Applies shaders based on the first activated pack in Global Resource Packs.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known issues
* Doesn't support long folder path and too many shader files.
* Antivirus may prevent IObit Unlocker from working. (AVG and Norton are known to do this)
* Some shaders crash. It's not an issue of Matject.

## ü§î FAQ
**Q. What is matjectNEXT?**  
A. matjectNEXT is an advanced version of Matject that replaces materials based on the pack the user has set in Global Resource Packs, with help of **[jq](https://jqlang.github.io/jq)**.  
Inspired by [Draco](https://github.com/mcbegamerxx954/draco-injector) which is made by [@mcbegamerxx954](https://github.com/mcbegamerxx954/).

**Q. How is this different from [BetterRenderDragon](https://github.com/ddf8196/BetterRenderDragon/)?**  
A. BetterRenderDragon uses *memory injection*, all the changes are made in memory and those don't persist. You have to open BRD each time to use shaders.  
*It's not universal, so BRD devs have to update it for newer Minecraft versions to make it work.*  
Changes made by Matject will stay until Minecraft is updated or user restores default materials from Matject.  
It's mostly universal, so it should work with any Minecraft version.

**Q. Virus?**  
A. Well, depends on you. (2) `(hint: it's not.)`

**Q. Does it require internet to work?**  
A. No, internet is optionally used to enhance user experience
* To check for updates and show the changelog. Updating is optional.
* To show Matject announcements
* To get [jq](https://jqlang.github.io/jq) by itself (for matjectNEXT).  
* To get [material-updater](https://github.com/mcbegamerxx954/material-updater) by itself.  

**Q. I have questions/need help.**  
A. Join [Newb Discord Server](https://faizul726.github.io/newb-discord) and send message in `#newb-support`. I will try to help.  


**Q. What folders does it access?**  
<details closed>
<summary>A. It accesses the following folders: </summary>

> ###### READ only:
> - `%ProgramFiles(x86)%\IObit\IObit Unlocker\IObitUnlocker` (backbone of Matject)
